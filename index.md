### CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I was struggling with the previous labs. Yet when we got to this lab specifically part 2 I finally was able to understand everything, and what the code ment or was doing. It was such a relief and I was able to actually have fun while doing the assignment.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite because it was when we learned black jack. Also we were including argument sizes and bools, and it was fun to write out. The best part might have been feeling able to take charge and teach because my partner was struggling to understand and I helped him learn what the assignment was!


* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was the bane of my existence for a week. It was a difficult lab at the time, and my partner was able to figure a part out after we had worked together. Following our meet, I linted and formatted it for us yet I kept getting an error. For days I had an error and was getting very frustrated and finally I saw my mistake of double assigning a variable as an int and double. I was so mad at myself for the simple mistake and now it's a lesson to always thoroughly line by line to check my code.
